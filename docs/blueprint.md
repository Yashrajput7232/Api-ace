# **App Name**: API Ace

## Core Features:

- API Request Builder: Construct and send API requests with customizable methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), headers, query parameters, and request body. Supports various content types.
- Response Viewer: Display API responses in a formatted and readable JSON view, including response status, headers, and response time.
- Collection Creation: Create and manage collections of API requests, organizing them for easy access and reusability. The maximum amount of collections created may be constrained in the interest of minimizing local storage footprint. Collections should only be saved by exporting or using an access code.
- Request Saving: Save individual API requests within collections for future use. Requests persist locally using browser storage. Only save manually on user confirmation to help avoid performance problems with local storage, and also maximize available space. This action could also automatically generate or update the access code to match the current collection in local storage.
- Collection Import/Export: Import collections from JSON files and export collections to JSON files, enabling users to share and back up their API configurations. Generate an access code if none is present during import, or update it, while persisting it to local storage for ease of use.
- Access Code Retrieval: Securely retrieve collections from local storage using a unique access code (UUID) generated for each collection, enabling account-free access to saved configurations.
- Suggested API Requests: Generates potential values for API request parameters based on user descriptions, using a tool powered by AI. This will let users who don't know their APIs as well benefit from common patterns used with other, similar APIs.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric Blue (#7DF9FF) for a modern, high-tech feel.
- Background color: Dark gray (#28282B) for a sleek, focused environment.
- Accent color: Vivid Purple (#BE3455) for interactive elements and highlights, complementing the electric blue.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for a futuristic and technical appeal; body text: 'Inter' sans-serif to maintain readability and a modern style.
- Use minimalistic, line-based icons to represent API methods and actions.
- Employ a tabbed interface or sidebar for easy navigation between collections and requests.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to enhance user interaction and provide visual feedback.
